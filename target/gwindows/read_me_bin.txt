This is a binary distribution of Wasabee for the Windows platform.
As you will see it is still *very* rudimentary, but you can display several Web pages without a crash...
Although buttons are not visible, navigation shortcuts are working:

  Alt - left arrow   : back
  Alt - right arrow  : forward
  Ctrl-N             : new window
  Ctrl-T             : new tab
  Ctrl-tab           : toggle to next tab  

Enjoy!
