# Wasabee

The project Wasabee aims at providing a Web browser fully written in Ada.

The project is in early development stage.

Currently supported:
  - some ubiquitous HTML tags
  - images
  - some of CSS

Currently *not* supported:
  - HTTPS (encrypted HTTP)
  - Almost everything ;-)
  
Currently defined targets:
  - GWindows                         . . . Windows-only
  - SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)   . . . multiple Operating Systems
  - Text-only (like Lynx)            . . . multiple Operating Systems

You will find GNAT Project files (.gpr) in subdirectories of the
"target" directory.
If you read those .gpr files as texts, you will find further instructions.
